## Introduction
"In the last 30 days, 1 out of every 25 adult drivers has fallen asleep at the wheel."
It's not something we want to admit, but it's a serious issue with serious ramifications that must be handled. Drowsy driving is responsible for one out of every four car accidents, and one out of every 25 adult drivers has fallen asleep behind the wheel in the last 30 days. The most terrifying aspect is that drowsy driving isn't merely falling asleep behind the wheel. When a driver is not paying full attention to the road, drowsy driving can be as simple as a momentary episode of unconsciousness. Each year, drowsy driving causes about 71,000 injuries, 1,500 deaths, and $12.5 billion in financial losses. We believe it is critical to create a solution for sleepiness detection, especially in the light of the problem's importance.
We also feel that tiredness can have a negative impact on people in the workplace and in the classroom. Although sleep deprivation and college go hand in hand, drowsiness in the workplace, particularly when operating with heavy machinery, can lead to significant injuries akin to those caused by driving while inebriated.
Our approach to this problem is to create a detection system that recognizes key sleepiness characteristics and sends out an alert before it's too late.

## Choosing this Project?
We are familiar with the hazards of drinking and driving or even texting and driving, but many people underestimate the dangers of drowsy driving. According to the National Safety Council, sleepy driving causes 100,000 collisions, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 deaths per year (NSC). According to AAA, drowsy driving is responsible for 9.5 percent of all crashes.
NHTSA found that many drowsy-driving crashes involve a single vehicle, with no passengers besides the driver, running off the road at a high rate of speed with no evidence of braking. Drowsy driving accidents frequently occur on rural roads and highways.
However, the actual number may be much higher as it is difficult to determine whether a driver was drowsy at the time of a crash. In many cases, drowsy driving is as dangerous as driving while impaired by alcohol.
Drowsy driving mimics alcohol-impaired driving â€” 18 hours without sleep is similar to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .05% (CDC)[2]

Effects of drowsy driving [1]

### Risk factors associated with drowsy driving
Risk factor & Description

_Time of day_ -- Accidents are most common in the early morning hours, the middle of the afternoon and late at night, when the body is generally at rest.

_Speed_ -- Accidents tend to be both more frequent and more severe when higher speeds are involved, which is why crashes on highways are so common.

_Driver habits and behaviour_ -- Studies show that drowsy drivers brake less, severely hampering their ability to avoid an accident. Many times, cars veer off the road and end up in embankments or wrapped around surrounding objects.
